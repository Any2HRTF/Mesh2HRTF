#General information

Mesh2HRTF was developed at the Acoustics Research Institute. Mesh2HRTF is an open-source project aiming at providing an easy-to-use software package for the numerical calculation of HRTFs. It targets researchers in the field of binaural audio. In a nutshell, Mesh2HRTF simply reads geometrical data, calculates the corresponding sound field and outputs HRTFs. To support multiple computer platforms, the concept of Mesh2HRTF is to focus on a command-line tool, which forms the numerical core, i.e., an implementation of the 3-dimensional Burton-Miller collocation BEM coupled with the multi-level fast multipole method (ML-FMM), and to provide add-ons for existing cross-platform applications for the preprocessing of geometrical data and for the visualization of results.
