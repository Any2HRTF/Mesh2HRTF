# Info:
# Simple example material.
# Admittance increases linearly with frequency from admittance/(rho*c)=0 at 0 Hz
# to admittance/(rho*c)=100 at 20 kHz (see note below).
#
# Keyword to define the boundary condition:
# ADMI: Normalized admittance boundary condition
# PRES: Pressure boundary condition
# VELO: Velocity boundary condition
# NOTE: Mesh2HRTF expects normalized admittances, i.e., admittance/(rho*c).
#       rho is the density of air and c the speed of sound. The normalization is
#       beneficial because a single material file can be used for simulations
#       with differing speed of sound and density of air.
ADMI
#
# Frequency curve:
# Frequency in Hz, real value, imaginary value
# NOTE: Mesh2HRTF interpolates the specified values to the frequencies that are
#       simulated. E.g., a normalized admittance of 50 would be used at 10 kHz.
