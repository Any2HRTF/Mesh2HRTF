# Info:
# simple material for testing: Admittance increases linearly with
# frequency from admittance=0 at 0 Hz to admittance=100 at 20 kHz
#
# Keyword to define the boundary condition:
# ADMI: Admittance boundary condition
# IMPE: Impedance boundary condition
# PRES: Pressure boundary condition
# VELO: Velocity boundary condition
ADMI
#
# Frequency curve:
# Frequency in Hz, real value, immaginary value
0, 0, 0
20e3, 100, 0
