evaluation_grids
----------------

Evaluation grids stored as text files for testing write/read_evaluation_grid

nc.out
------

Contains NC*.out files for testing the project report

SHTF
----

Contains a complete Mesh2HRTF project with spherical head transfer functions
calculated up to 6 kHz. The output was generated manually by running
mesh2hrtf.output2hrtf and inspect_sofa_files

SOFA_files
----------
SOFA file for testing compute_hrirs

test_blender_export
----

Contains Blender files and a Python script for testing the installtion of the Blender mesh2input add-on and exporting mesh2HRTF projects with all variations of export parameters

test_numcalc
----

Contains multiple folders user for testing correct function of NumCalc in test_cum_calc.py

test_numcalc/analytical_references
----

Contains .mat-files with analytically computed reference sound fields to compare the NumCalc simulations to, and .m-file MATLAB scripts to generate these. .jpg-files are also stored here, generated by test_num_calc.py, to visually compare the analytically and numerically computed sound fields.
The reference sound fields are the scattering of a point source or plane wave off a rigid or sound-soft sphere.

test_numcalc/ncinp_files
----

Contains NC.inp files covering the various test conditions.

test_numcalc/project_folder_ears
----

Contains a basic mesh2HRTF project folder "ears_basic_project" for a spherical head transfer function, and modular folders "bothears", "leftear" and "rightear" which are copied into the project folder during testing to cover the three different test conditions.

test_numcalc/project_folder_pspw
----

Contains a mesh2HRTF project for the point source and plane wave scattering test conditions.
