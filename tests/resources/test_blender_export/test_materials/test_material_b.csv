# Info:
# Sound soft material defined using a pressure (PRES) boundary condition.
# Sound soft materials have a zero pressure on the surface
#
# Keyword to define the boundary condition:
# ADMI: Normalized admittance boundary condition
# PRES: Pressure boundary condition
# VELO: Velocity boundary condition
# NOTE: Mesh2HRTF expects normalized admittances, i.e., admittance/(rho*c).
#       rho is the density of air and c the speed of sound. The normalization is
#       beneficial because a single material file can be used for simulations
#       with differing speed of sound and density of air.
