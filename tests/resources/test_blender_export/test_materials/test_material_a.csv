# Info:
# Simple example material.
# Admittance increases linearly with frequency from
# admittance/(rho*c)=0 at 2000 Hz to
# admittance/(rho*c)=1 at 2001 Hz.
# An admittance of 0 will be assumed below 2000 Hz and 1 above 2001 Hz.
#
# Keyword to define the boundary condition:
# ADMI: Normalized admittance boundary condition
# PRES: Pressure boundary condition
# VELO: Velocity boundary condition
# NOTE: Mesh2HRTF expects normalized admittances, i.e., admittance/(rho*c).
#       rho is the density of air and c the speed of sound. The normalization is
#       beneficial because a single material file can be used for simulations
#       with differing speed of sound and density of air.
ADMI
#
# Frequency curve:
# Frequency in Hz, real value, imaginary value
# NOTE: Mesh2HRTF interpolates the specified values to the frequencies that are
#       simulated. E.g., a normalized admittance of 50 would be used at 10 kHz.
