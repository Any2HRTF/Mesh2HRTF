Mesh2HRTF
=========

Mesh2HRTF is an open-source project aiming at providing an easy-to-use software package for the numerical calculation of head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). It targets researchers in the field of binaural audio. In a nutshell, Mesh2HRTF consists of three parts:
- Mesh2Input: prepares geometrical data and acoustic parameters,
- NumCalc: based on the input from Mesh2Input, it calculates the corresponding sound field
- Output2HRTFs: processes the output from NumCalc to HRTFs saved in the SOFA format.
