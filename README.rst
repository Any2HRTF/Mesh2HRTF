`Mesh2HRTF <https://mesh2hrtf.org>`_ is an open-source software package for the numerical calculation of the head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). It targets researchers in the field of binaural audio. In a nutshell, Mesh2HRTF consists of three parts:

- Mesh2Input: preparation of the 3D head mesh and the acoustic parameters (source position, acoustic materials).
- NumCalc: wave-based numerical solver to calculate the sound pressure on the mesh and to project to the specified positions in the free field.
- Output2HRTFs: processing of the output from NumCalc to obtain HRTFs saved as SOFA files.

Mesh2HRTF is not an application - it is a toolbox aiming at researchers in the field of acoustics. Thus, before starting to use Mesh2HRTF, we assume the knowledge of the following background information:

- [1]_ and [2]_: General introductions to Mesh2HRTF as a whole.
- [3]_ and [4]_: Requirements on the mesh quality.
- [3]_: Information about the potential source and microphone models.
- [5]_ and [6]_: Introduction to mesh-grading strategies to reduce the RAM consumption and computation time.
- [7]_: Further background information on the wave-based numerical solver NumCalc used to calculate the HRTFs.
