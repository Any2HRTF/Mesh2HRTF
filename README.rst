Mesh2HRTF is an open-source project aiming at providing an easy-to-use software package for the numerical calculation of head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). It targets researchers in the field of binaural audio. In a nutshell, Mesh2HRTF consists of three parts:

- Mesh2Input: prepare the 3D head (and torso) mesh and the acoustic parameters (source position, acoustic materials),
- NumCalc: calculates the sound pressure on the 3D mesh and at user specified position around it
- Output2HRTFs: processes the output from NumCalc to HRTFs saved in the SOFA format.

Before starting to use Mesh2HRTF we recommend the following background information to obtain the best possible results

- [1]_ gives a general introduction into Mesh2HRTF as a whole.
- [2]_ and [3]_ detail the required mesh quality.
- [2]_ gives information about possible source/microphone models.
- [4]_ and [5]_ introduce mesh grading strategies to reduce the RAM requirements and computation time of the numerical HRTF calculation.
- [6]_ gives background information on the wave based numerical solver NumCalc that is used to calculate the HRTFs.
- [7]_ first introduces Mesh2HRTF as a whole.
