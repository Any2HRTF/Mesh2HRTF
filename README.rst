Mesh2scattering
==============

Mesh2scattering is based on Mesh2HRTF and is an open-source project aiming an easy-to-use software package for the numerical calculation of scattering pattern and scattering and diffusion coeffients of any surface. In a nutshell, Mesh2scattering consists of three parts:
- Mesh2Input: prepares geometrical data and acoustic parameters,
- NumCalc: based on the input from Mesh2Input, it calculates the corresponding sound field
- Output2scattering: processes the output from NumCalc to scattering and/or diffusion coeffients.
Please notice that this project does not support HRTF post processing, use Mesh2HRTF instead.
