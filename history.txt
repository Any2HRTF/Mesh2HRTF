*** DEVELOPMENT STATUS ***

*** v0.2.0 (Fabian Brinkmann, Robert Pelzer)
- Output2HRTF_Main.m: Added optional referencing of HRTFs if calculated reciprocally to achieve that the low frequency magnitude of the HRTFs is 0 dB. This is done by dividing the complex pressure by the area of the ear elements (radiating element), compensating for the velocity of the radiating element, and by a division of the complex pressure with the pressure of a point source in the origin of coordinates. (export_mesh2hrtf.py writes the area of the radiating elements, and the flag for referencing to Output2HRTF.m)
- Arbitrary user defined evaluation grids (spatial sampling grids) can now be generated with the Matlab code in PreProcessing/WriteReadEvaluationGrids/demo.m (The folder 'User' in 'Mesh2Input/Data/Evaluation Grids' was renamed to 'Custom' for this purpose, because 'User' is a reserved variable in Blender/Python)
- The evaluation grids (spatial sampling grids) that are part of Mesh2HRTF can now be plotted with the Matlab code in PreProcessing/WriteReadEvaluationGrids/demo.m
- Added a Python script that can be loaded into Blender to center the head mesh in the coordinate system (PreProcessing/MaterialAssignment/MaterialAssignment.py)
- Added a Python script that can be loaded into Blender to automatically assign the materials 'Skin', 'Left ear', and 'Right ear' (PreProcessing/MeshCentering/MeshCentering.py)
export_mesh2hrtf.py: Bug fix to correctly export data for calculating the left ear, right ear and both ears.
Output2HRTF_Main.m: Big fix to correctly export SOFA files with data for the left ear, right ear, and both ears.



*** v0.1.3 (1.6.2018, Wolfgang Kreuzer, Harald Ziegelwanger, Piotr Majdak)
- mesh-grading plugin for Open Flipper added
- Output: various bug fixes
- Output: Paraview scripts added 
- NumCalc: Dissolve tiny clusters and add their elements to next bigger cluster. This seems to enhance the stability of the MLFMM.

*** v1.0.2 (18.6.2016, Harald Ziegelwanger)
