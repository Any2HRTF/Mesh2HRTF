Mesh2scattering
==============

Mesh2scattering is based on Mesh2HRTF and is an open-source project aiming an easy-to-use software package for the numerical calculation of scattering pattern and scattering and diffusion coeffients of any surface. In a nutshell, Mesh2scattering consists of three parts:
- Mesh2Input: prepares geometrical data and acoustic parameters,
- NumCalc: based on the input from Mesh2Input, it calculates the corresponding sound field
- Output2scattering: processes the output from NumCalc to scattering and/or diffusion coeffients.
Please notice that this project does not support HRTF post processing, use Mesh2HRTF instead.

Installation
============

## Using mesh2scattering with Python

- needed Software 
The Python API needs to installed in the terminal, before it can be used.

Environment It is recommended to create an environment for mesh2scattering. This can for example be done with conda or Anaconda in a terminal or the Anaconda Prompt. 

``conda create --name mesh2scattering python``

``conda activate mesh2scattering``

Install mesh2scattering package To make mesh2HRTF available in Python, go to your mesh2HRTF directory (the one containing setup.py) by running cd your/path/to/mesh2hrtf-git

Then install mesh2scattering using pip

``pip install -e .``

Note that the -e option will make changes in mesh2scattering immediately available. This is helpful if you adapt parts of the code to your needs. If you do not want this, omit this option.

You can now use mesh2scattering by importing it in your Python code, e.g. ``import mesh2scattering as m2s``

Testing If you want to develop or test mesh2scattering make sure to also install the requirements listed in setup.py under test_requirements, e.g. ``pip install -r requirements_python.txt``

Don't forget to

``pip install ipykernel``

in case you want to interactively debug your changes.
