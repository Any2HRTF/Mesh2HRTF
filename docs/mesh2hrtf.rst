====================

This is the documentation. Of the Python API for Mesh2HRTF. For everything else
visit the
`Mesh2HRTF Wiki text <https://sourceforge.net/p/mesh2hrtf/wiki/Home/>`_

The main function of the Python API is ``output_to_hrtf`` which reads
the raw simulation results and saves them as SOFA files. It reads all required
parameters from `parameters.json`, which is generated upon exporting a
Mesh2HRTF project from Blender.
