This is the documentation. Of the Python part of the Mesh2HRTF API. For the
complete Mesh2HRTF documentation visit the
`Wiki <https://github.com/Any2HRTF/Mesh2HRTF/wiki>`_, or find more information
about the Mesh2HRTF API

The main function of the Python API is ``output2hrtf`` which reads
the raw simulation results and saves them as SOFA files. It reads all required
